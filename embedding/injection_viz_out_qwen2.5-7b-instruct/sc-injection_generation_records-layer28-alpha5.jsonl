My heart feels heavy, like a boulder is sitting atop my chest. Anger surges through me, making my blood boil. Each word out of [Partner's] mouth only stirs that inferno, turning into fuel for my resentment. Trust once so easily held now shatters around us, leaving behind broken pieces strewn everywhere. I struggle not to lash out verbally or physically; instead, I focus on holding back tears threatening to spill down my cheeks. This isn't just about money anymore—it’s about respect, communication, and being valued in our relationship. The room seems too small, pressing in on both sides, suffocating any chance of calm discussion. All I want right now is space—time away from them where I can process these overwhelming emotions before trying again later when we might actually hear each other. But until then... silence reigns between us. Inside, chaos rages while outwardly, nothing gives away what lies beneath. *End*", "generated_injected": "Inside, I'm seething with rage and hurt. Betrayal courses through my veins like wildfire, leaving me numb yet intensely aware of the pain. My heart races uncontrollably, pounding against my ribcage with each harsh breath.

BetRAYAL cuts deep, slicing through layers of trust until nothing remains but raw vulnerability. My pulse thrums wildly under my skin, matching the relentless drumming of my chest as I listen to their feeble attempts to defend themselves. Logic crumbles before the torrent of emotion flooding my senses—anger surges, fueled by every justification offered, making rational thought impossible. A tempest of resentment brews, threatening explosion at any second. \n\nTrust hangs precariously between us, teetering on the brink of collapse. If we don’t find common ground here, this breach may widen irreparably.
